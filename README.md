PINN Library
---
This repository is an organized set of examples of physically informed neural networks (PINN).  The paper which originally coined this term can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00314-5).  The [CRUNCH group](https://sites.brown.edu/crunch-group/) at Brown University has a nice [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CrunchGroup) which organizes routine lectures on the subject, and is a nice reference.

The logo for this repository was generated using Google Gemini (Imagen 3) on Dec. 10, 2024 with the prompt "Draw a cartoon of a pine grosbeak bird with a monocle."  The pine grosbeak ([PIN]icola e[N]ucleator) is a member of the finch family and was chosen based on its scientific name.
